## WHY YOU SHOULD CARE

.

### SEARCH LEAKAGE 

At other search engines, when you do a search and then click on a link, your search terms are sent to that site you clicked on (in the HTTP referrer header).
We call this sharing of personal information "search leakage."

### SEARCH HISTORY

Other search engines save your search history.
Usually your searches are saved along with the date and time of the search, some information about your computer (e.g. your IP address, User agent and often a unique identifier stored in a browser cookie), and if you are logged in, your account information (e.g. name and email address).
